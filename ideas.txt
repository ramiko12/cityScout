### Project Ideas ###

1. News Hub - X
	a) Aggregated News Recommender System
2. Game Matchmaking
3. Social Lunch/Dinner planner
	- login (accounts)
	- create events
	- invite people to events
	- event scheduler
	- food picker
	- attendance checker
4. Fact Checker
5. Moving to a new city helper (A.K.A askTheLocals.com working title)
	-determines cost for basic living 
	based on minimum wage and or income
	determines popular jobs in the city
	determines popular entertainment spots
	determines cost for rent
	cost for internet
	cost for phone 
	cost for food
	etc..

	So for the moving to a new city idea I have a concept for it
So when you open the app you sign up and you provide information about where you live (price of rent in cheap area , price of rent downtown , average food item prices , average clothing prices )Seen by Gianluca Martellacci at 1:12pm
And then of you want to move to another city you would use information that another user provided about his city
So the users provide the information
And we can average out the results
Or use 10  most recent  information about certain city
So for example I sign up and provide information about Cairo and Vlad signs up with information about Romania and Graham signs up with info about Canada
And then if I want to move from Cairo to Canada I would use Graham's info to learn about the city
And vice versa
